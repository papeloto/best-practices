Recopilation of first-hand coding learning experiencies

## Mindset
### Use the framework

### Don't think with your fingers

### Languages are an implementation detail

Most people feel really attached to one programming language or stack. Don't get me wrong, it's great to specialize your skillset, but don't let that influence too much your decisions. Programming languages are tools, and some tools are better suited for one job. 

### Generic programming is not free

### Avoid multitasking

## Iteration
### Fail fast, to win in the future

My manager once told me:

If you want to build a car, you don't start creating the pieces separately, you start with an skateboard. 

I'm not saying that you should have everything setup from day one. What I'm saying is that you should have **everything necessary**.
If you are starting a web app for example, I don't expect you to have test suites running from day one, since everything will change so quickly. But I expect you to have a minimum deployment, a minimum MVP to work towards...

### Make it work, then make it better
